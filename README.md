Awesome Tiles is a tiling manager extension for GNOME Shell that makes it easy to move
windows around with precision. It does that with reconfigurable keyboard shortcuts
which are set to keys on the number pad by default.

## Usage

### Tiling Windows

The extension uses **Super + Number Pad** by default for quick tiling. Pressing the same shortcut multiple times cycles through different grid sizes (e.g., 50%, 75%, 33%).

### Column Tiling

Inspired by the [Tiles](https://freemacsoft.net/tiles/) app for macOS, a second set of shortcuts sizes the focused window to full height at a third, half, or two thirds of the screen width and moves it left or right. Pressing the same shortcut repeatedly steps the window through the three column positions: left, center, and right.

### Linked Resize

Hold **Alt** (reconfigurable in settings) while dragging a window edge to resize all adjacent tiled windows at once.

## Features

- **Smart Tiling**: Tile windows in 9 different ways using the number pad.
- **Column Tiling**: Make a window a third, half, or two thirds of the screen wide at full height and step it left or right through the left, center, and right positions (like the Tiles app for macOS).
- **Dynamic Grid Sizes**: Successive key presses cycle through different tiling sizes (e.g., 50%, 75%, 33%).
- **Linked Resizing**: Resize adjacent tiled windows simultaneously by holding a modifier key (**Alt** by default).
- **Customizable Gaps**: Add and adjust gaps around windows and between them to suit your preference.
- **Center Alignment**: Quickly align any window to the center of the workspace without resizing.
- **Fully Reconfigurable**: All keyboard shortcuts and tiling steps can be customized in the settings.
- **Workspace Navigation**: Integrated shortcuts for switching workspaces and moving windows between them.

## Installation

### From GNOME Extensions (Recommended)

1. Go to <https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4702/awesome-tiles/>
2. Install and Enable.

### From source code

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/velitasali/gnome-shell-extension-awesome-tiles.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the folder**:
    ```bash
    cd gnome-shell-extension-awesome-tiles
    ```
3.  **Run the local installation command**:
    ```bash
    ./install.sh local-install
    ```

## Available Translations

The extension is translated into the following languages:

- **Arabic** (`ar`)
- **German** (`de`)
- **Greek** (`el`)
- **Spanish** (`es`)
- **French** (`fr`)
- **Italian** (`it`)
- **Japanese** (`ja`)
- **Korean** (`ko`)
- **Dutch** (`nl`)
- **Polish** (`pl`)
- **Russian** (`ru`)
- **Turkish** (`tr`)
- **Ukrainian** (`uk`)
- **Chinese (Simplified)** (`zh_CN`)

## Development

A containerized development environment is provided to test the extension in various locales without affecting your host system.

### Dependencies (Host System)

To run the development environment, you need the following packages installed on your host:

- `docker`
- `x11docker`
- `inotify-tools` (for the file watcher)
- `gettext` (for translation compilation)
- `glib2.0` (for schema compilation)
- `rsync`

### Usage

1. **Start the development session**:

   ```bash
   ./dev/start-dev.sh
   ```

   This will build the development image (if it doesn't exist), setup the extension, and launch GNOME Shell inside a container.

2. **Testing different locales**:
   You can specify a language using the `--lang` argument:

   ```bash
   ./dev/start-dev.sh --lang=de_DE.UTF-8
   ```

3. **Rebuilding the image**:
   If you modify the `Dockerfile`, force a rebuild of the container image:
   ```bash
   ./dev/start-dev.sh rebuild
   ```

### How it Works (Hot Reload)

The `start-dev.sh` script includes an integrated watcher that monitors the `src/` and `po/` directories:

- **Watcher**: Uses `inotifywait` to detect file saves.
- **Syncing**: Automatically syncs `src/` files to the development directory.
- **Compiling**:
  - Compiles GSettings schemas using `glib-compile-schemas`.
  - Compiles `.po` files into `.mo` binaries using `msgfmt`.
- **Hot Reload**: When a change is detected, the GNOME Shell container is automatically restarted to apply the fresh build immediately.

### Translation

Create a copy of `po/awesome-tiles@velitasali.com.pot` in the **same directory** and name it
as follows:

- `<LANGUAGE_CODE>.po` for a language.
- `<LANGUAGE_CODE>_<COUNTRY_CODE>.po` for a language spoken in a specific region.

Examples:

- `ja.po` for the Japanese language translation.
- `de_AT.po` for the German language spoken in Austria.
